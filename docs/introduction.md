# Introduction

JumpServer is an open-source **Privileged Access Management (PAM)** system designed to manage and monitor privileged accounts in your organization.  
It provides a **secure gateway** for administrators, developers, and auditors to access critical IT resources, while ensuring **granular control**, **detailed auditing**, and **regulatory compliance**.

JumpServer helps organizations **reduce risks** associated with privileged accounts by providing centralized management and real-time monitoring of user activities.

## Why JumpServer?

Privileged accounts such as system administrators, database admins, and network engineers have **elevated access rights** that, if misused, could cause serious damage or data breaches.  
JumpServer addresses these challenges by:

- **Eliminating direct access** to production systems.  
- Enforcing **strong authentication** (MFA, certificates, tokens).  
- Tracking every action through **session recording and logs**.  
- Providing **role-based access control (RBAC)** to enforce the principle of least privilege.

By implementing JumpServer, organizations can **simplify operations**, **increase security posture**, and **meet compliance standards** such as GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.
